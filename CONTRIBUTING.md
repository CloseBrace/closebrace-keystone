Hey, thanks for your interest in CloseBrace. I (Chris Buecheler) am always interested in receiving pull requests, whether they be new features, improvements, or just fixing some crappy bit of code I should be ashamed of. If you'd like to contribute, please keep in mind the following:

 - Please contact me first if you intend to add features. I have general plans for CloseBrace moving forward, and I'd hate to duplicate work or have to toss anything out because it doesn't fit with the vision for the site.
 - We don't have a testing suite established yet, but it's coming. If you have thoughts on best practices for testing, please get in touch.
 - Please create an open issue that specifies what it is you intend to work on, if one does not already exist. Please then create a branch that contains the same issue number (eg: 7-adding-comments) in which to do your work.
 - Please follow the existing coding conventions, naming conventions, and similar. Two-space tabs, semi-colons, brace style, etc.
 - That's about it for now. You can find CloseBrace at our [blog](http://blog.closebrace.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/closebracejs), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/closebrace/), or [Facebook](). Tons of ways to get in touch if you want to talk!
