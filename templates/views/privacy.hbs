          <p>Your privacy is important to us.</p>

          <p>It is CloseBrace, LLC's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.

                <li>To allow the user to personalize that account if they so choose</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.</li>
            <li>We will protect personal information by using reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</li>
            <li>We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.</li>
            <li>We will only retain personal information for as long as necessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.</li>
            <li>A user may contact CloseBrace, LLC at any time to request the complete removal of their data from our servers, or may do so themselves through the delete account button on the account page. This removes <em>all user data</em> from CloseBrace, LLC's database servers.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained. CloseBrace, LLC may change this privacy policy from time to time at CloseBrace, LLC's sole discretion.</p>

          <h3>A Note on Credit Cards</h3>

          <p>
            CloseBrace, LLC <em>does not store</em> credit card data on its servers. In fact, the CloseBrace website never transmits credit card data over an HTTP connection (including HTTPS). Instead, credit card information is tokenized&mdash;converted to an encrypted hash&mdash;on the client side before being transferred to our payment processor, Stripe. Only this token is stored, both by Stripe and by CloseBrace, LLC, and in neither case can it be reverse-engineered.
          </p>

          <p>
            This means that even if your account is maliciously compromised, no credit card data of any sort would be available to the the aggressor.
